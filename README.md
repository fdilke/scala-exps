# scala-exps (Scala experiments)

This is a sandbox for experiments with aspects of Scala.
Most of them are just to learn about the language but may turn
out to be useful for other projects.

## Bewl: done
Bind classes to dots, and to the sources and targets of arrows
Fixed chained products
Can multiply arrows with f x g, in a world of 'standardized products'

## language 'tests'

These capture my understanding of various language features.

## Permutations

Classes to multiply permutations, manipulate them, determine parity

## Groups

Generate a group from a bunch of permutations
