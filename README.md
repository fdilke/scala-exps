# scala-exps (Scala experiments)

This is a sandbox for experiments with aspects of Scala.
Most of them are just to learn about the language but may turn
out to be useful for other projects.

## Functional Mottoes

[Presentation](https://github.com/fdilke/scala-exps/blob/master/notes/FunctionalMottoes.pdf) about these
gems of the pure lambda calculus, and my efforts to enumerate them

## Bewl: done
Bind classes to dots, and to the sources and targets of arrows
Fixed chained products
Can multiply arrows with f x g, in a world of 'standardized products'
Standardized exponents
Added equalizers

## language 'tests'

These capture my understanding of various language features.

## Permutations

Classes to multiply permutations, manipulate them, determine parity

## Groups

Generate a group from a bunch of permutations
