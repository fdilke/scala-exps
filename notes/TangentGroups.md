# Tangent Groups

Given a field F, we can attempt to make the set 
(F + infinity) into an abelian group by defining

    a * b = (a + b) / (1 - ab)

When a = infinity, the right hand side is interpreted as -1/b.

This works (verify) if -1 isn't a square in F, which for finite fielfds GF(q)
is the case precisely if q = 3 mod 4 (verify).

What's the structure of this group of order q + 1?

More generally if F is a division ring, do we get a nonabelian version?
