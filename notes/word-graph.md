# Word graph

given a set of words, consider any 2 "adjacent"
if they have at least one letter in common.
This makes the set into a graph. e.g. US states

then: have players alternate choosing a word,
not chosen before, "adjacent" to the last chosen one

# Questions

When is a position P, or N? Presumably P (with no previous selection) is a (moderately deep?)
property of the graph
is this computable for US states, by brute force
i.e. without some insight?
