# scala-exps (Scala experiments)

## permutations

Be able to multiply permutations, manipulate them, determine parity

## groups

Generate a group from a bunch of permutations
? Calculate all the subgroups
? Arrange them in a structure so we can generate a sequence of upward and downward 'segues'
? Precalculate coset representatives
? have them act on vectors
? have them act on 'transformables' e.g. a set of lines and circles
? generate the dihedral group of order 4
? have a concept of: convex combination in a segue acting on 'transformables'
